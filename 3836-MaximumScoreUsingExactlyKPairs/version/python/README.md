You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths n and m respectively, and an integer k.

You must choose exactly k pairs of indices (i1, j1), (i2, j2), ..., (ik, jk) such that:


	0 <= i1 < i2 < ... < ik < n
	0 <= j1 < j2 < ... < jk < m


For each chosen pair (i, j), you gain a score of nums1[i] * nums2[j].

The total score is the sum of the products of all selected pairs.

Return an integer representing the maximum achievable total score.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,3,2], nums2 = [4,5,1], k = 2

Output: 22

Explanation:

One optimal choice of index pairs is:


	(i1, j1) = (1, 0) which scores 3 * 4 = 12
	(i2, j2) = (2, 1) which scores 2 * 5 = 10


This gives a total score of 12 + 10 = 22.


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [-2,0,5], nums2 = [-3,4,-1,2], k = 2

Output: 26

Explanation:

One optimal choice of index pairs is:


	(i1, j1) = (0, 0) which scores -2 * -3 = 6
	(i2, j2) = (2, 1) which scores 5 * 4 = 20


The total score is 6 + 20 = 26.


Example 3:


Input: nums1 = [-3,-2], nums2 = [1,2], k = 2

Output: -7

Explanation:

The optimal choice of index pairs is:


	(i1, j1) = (0, 0) which scores -3 * 1 = -3
	(i2, j2) = (1, 1) which scores -2 * 2 = -4


The total score is -3 + (-4) = -7.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n == nums1.length <= 100
	1 <= m == nums2.length <= 100
	-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106
	1 <= k <= min(n, m)
